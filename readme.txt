Read Me - Grid2048 Game

Grid based 2048 game, where merge tiles to make a 2048 tile.
It's based on the idea from http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ , which is based on idea from IPhone Game Three.

Note - The code implemented, algorithms used are devised by me. Cause the main reason was to do something challenging and fun, and what more challenging than to devise game algorithm on your own.

It's fully functional game, but right now it's open ended as in you can go far beyond 2048 (if you're not bored). The only thing it lacks is the animation for the grids when they move, which I will try to add in by next commit.
